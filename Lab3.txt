    distributed tracing across multiple services using Stack Driver Trace 
            as a trace collection and analysis platform
    authentication so that you can implement managed access to Google Cloud Services from Java applications
    Trace is a distributed tracing system that collects latency data from your applications and displays it in the GCP console.
           You can track or request, propagate through your application, and receive detailed near real time performance insights. 
    Trace automatically analyzes all of your application's traces to generate in-depth latency reports to surface performance degradations 
           and can capture traces from all of your REMs, containers, or App Engine projects
    The Trace SDK is currently available for Java, Node.js, Ruby and Go, and the Stack Driver Trace API 
            can be used to submit and retrieve trace data from any source. 
    A Zipkin collector is also available that allows Zipkin tracers to submit data to trace. 
            Projects running on App Engine are automatically captured.
